Exercise 1:
I Created  process using fork()
When fork() is executed, the operating system makes a copy of the current process.
The return value of fork() determines which process is running:
If fork() == 0: this is the child process.
If fork() > 0  : this is the parent process 
If fork() <0 :  process creation failed.
getpid() is used to print the pid of each process .
This helps show that parent and child are running at the same time.

Linking file1.c and file2.c 
This shows how two separate C files can work together in one program. file1.c contains the actual function that prints a message.
file2.c calls the function although function is written in another file. 
both files are combined and linked to create one executable.
the final program prints the message from the function hello() in file1.c

This example shows how a simple c program is compiled and then checked to see which shared libraries it uses.
After compiling the program into an executable,
the ldd command is used to list all libraries that program depends on when it runs
This demonstrates how programs do not contain everything inside them, but instead depend on external shared libraries that loader brings into memory when program starts. 
_________________________________________________________________________________
The job of linker is to take two or more compiled object files and combine them into single executable

The job of loader is to load program into memory and load required shared libraries and start the program.
