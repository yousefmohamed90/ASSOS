 Process Management & Compilation

This repository includes:
- All code examples required 
- All written explanations required 
- A working Makefile to compile every example.
- A complete README.md following
- An open‑source LICENSE file.

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of process management, compilation, linking, and loading in Linux.

Topics covered:
- Creating processes using `fork()`
- Understanding the **Linker** with multi‑file C programs
- Understanding the **Loader** using `ldd`




##  Requirements
You need :
Linux terminal (Ubuntu)



## How to Build and Run
Compile everything:
make

Run any program:
./process_creation
./output_program
./simple_program

  
Exercises Implemented 
### ** fork() Process Creation**
Demonstrates parent and child processes.

###**Linker Role**
Two-file C program (`file1.c`, `file2.c`).

### ** Loader Role**
Use `ldd` to load shared libraries.
